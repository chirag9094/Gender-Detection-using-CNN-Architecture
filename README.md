# Gender-Detection-using-CNN-Architecture

## Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for gender detection from facial images. The model is trained on a custom dataset comprising two categories: male and female. The dataset consists of 96 male images and 99 female images, totaling 195 images.

## Key Features
1. Convolutional Neural Network: Utilizes a CNN architecture for feature extraction and classification of gender from facial images.
2. Custom Dataset: Training was conducted using a carefully curated dataset of 195 images, including 96 male and 99 female images.
3. Accuracy: Achieved an accuracy of 95% on the test dataset after training.

## Dataset and Training
The dataset used for training consists of 195 facial images categorized into male and female. Each image is annotated with the corresponding gender label, ensuring accurate model training and evaluation. The complete dataset used for training this model is present in the dataset folder.

## Model Architecture
The CNN architecture is designed to effectively learn discriminative features from facial images to distinguish between male and female subjects. It comprises multiple convolutional layers for feature extraction, followed by fully connected layers for classification.

## Results
The model demonstrates robust performance in gender classification, achieving a high accuracy of 95% on the test dataset.
